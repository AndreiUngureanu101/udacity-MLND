# udacity-MLND
:computer: This repo contains the projects for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

# List of projects:

- Machine Learning in Production: Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model for movie reviews :movie_camera:  
- Plagiarism Detector: Build a Plagiarism Detector that examines a text, compares it to a source text and labels it as:
	1) either plagiarises or not
	2) either plagiarised on different levels (***cut*** answers copy directly from a source text, ***light*** answers are based on the source text but include some light rephrasing, and ***heavy*** answers are based on the source text, but heavily rephrased) or not plagiarised
